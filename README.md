This is for my Linear Algebra class. I got to test it out with multiple matrices from homeworks, textbooks and the like, but you just never know how completely comprehensive something 
is until you do various tests. If for whatever reason there is an issue with it please let me know so that I could fix it. As it stands right now, it does row switch operations first
before any scalar operations for reduction, and if it turns out that we need to have them coincide, that is something that I could change about it.
For details on actual operations, please refer to the source text inside.
